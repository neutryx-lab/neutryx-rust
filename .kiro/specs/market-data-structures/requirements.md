## Project Description (Input)
Phase 2.1: Market Data Structures - Implement yield curve and volatility surface abstractions for quantitative finance pricing. This includes: (1) YieldCurve trait and implementations (FlatCurve, InterpolatedCurve) supporting discount factor and forward rate calculations, (2) VolatilitySurface trait and implementations (FlatVol, InterpolatedVolSurface) for implied volatility lookup by strike/expiry, (3) All structures must be generic over T: Float for Enzyme AD compatibility, (4) Integration with existing interpolation infrastructure from pricer_core::math::interpolators
